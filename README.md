# ESP32 Smart Control System

A simple and educational project that connects an ESP32 board to a Node.js server for real-time communication and control. It’s built for makers and students who want to learn how to send data between hardware and software easily.

## Features
- Flash ready-to-use ESP32 code via Arduino IDE  
- Custom `secrets.h` configuration for WiFi and server setup  
- Local Node.js server for ESP32 data handling  
- Easy-to-follow wiring and deployment steps  

## How It Works
1. Open the `.ino` file inside the `esp32` folder using Arduino IDE.  
2. Edit `secrets.h` to include your WiFi credentials and server IP.  
3. Run the Node.js server (`node index.mjs`) inside the `server` directory.  
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 and watch it connect!  

## Requirements
- ESP32 board  
- Arduino IDE  
- Node.js and npm installed
